# Covid-19-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning
In this exercise, you will solve an image classification task from medical imaging: classification in Chest X-Ray images into patients with Covid-19, Pneunomia or Healthy. We will use a subset of the dataset from a Kaggle challenge for this. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prashant268/chest-xray-covid19-pneumonia)

The main focus of this exercise is transfer learning and you will approach the classification task with three different approaches:

    Training ResNets from scratch. (Note that we will use the ResNet implementation from torchvision throughout the exercise).
    Training ResNets pretrained on ImageNet.
    Training ResNets pretrained on RadImageNet, a large radiology dataset.
